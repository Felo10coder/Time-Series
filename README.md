## Project Description
<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
# Time Series Analysis <a name="about-project"></a>

**Time Series Analysis** This project focuses on enhancing Corporation Favorita's inventory management through accurate product demand forecasting. Leveraging machine learning models and historical sales data, we aim to optimize inventory levels, minimize stockouts, and maximize profitability. By integrating advanced forecasting techniques into Corporation Favorita's operations, we seek to ensure always right quantity of product in stock. Through this data-driven approach, we aim to provide Corporation Favorita with actionable insights to make informed inventory management decisions and maintain a competitive edge in the retail industry.

## Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Business understanding: Understanding the project and formualating the hypotheis to test together with business questions to answer that will help in the analysis**
- **Data collection : Gathered comprehensive data on corporation favorita sales behaviour and factors influencing them**
- **Data Integration: Combine data from multiple sources such as SQL databases, csv files and GitHub repositories to create a unified dataset for analysis**
-**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Examining and understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. This involved summary statistic, univariate analysis , bivariate analysis, outlier detection and handling missing values**
 **Data Cleaning: preparing the unified data ready for analysis**
 - **Visualizations: Using matplotlib and seaborn to create visually appealing charts, graphs and heatmaps to help answer the business questions**
 - **Answering Business questions: Using visualizations to answer business questions that help in analysing the dataset**
 
- **Hypothesis Testing: Testing formulated Hypothesis about the relationship between items onpromotion and sales. Performing statistical analysis to test this hypothesis using the T-test test method**
- **Data preparation : Transforming the dataset into a format suitable for training and evaluating ML models. Encompassing a range of tasks to improve the quality, consistency, and relevance of the data, ultimately leading to better model performance and insights. It involes checking if the data is balanced, feature engineering, data transformation, data splitting , constructing pipelines.**
- **Modelling : Creating mathematical representations (models) that learn patterns and relationships from the dataset in order to make predictions on whether a customer will churn or not.Data is trained both when balanced and unbalanced. The models trained include;statistical models such as Autoregression(AR),AutoRegression Intergrated Moving Average (ARIMA),(SARIMA)Seasonal AutoRegression Intergrated Moving Average and traditional statistical models such as LinearRegression and XGBClassifier**

- **Hyperparameter Tuning : Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. They control aspects such as the complexity of the model and its capacity to learn.Hyperparameter tuning helps improve model performance by finding the optimal settings.It prevents overfitting or underfitting of the model by adjusting hyperparameters.Proper tuning can lead to better generalization on unseen data.The steps include Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different hyperparameter settings.Consider the computational cost when choosing a tuning technique.Start with a coarse search space and refine it based on initial results.Monitor the performance metrics closely to avoid overfitting to the validation set.**

- **saving the models: After training a machine learning model, it's important to save it for future use or deployment. Saving the model allows you to reuse it without the need to retrain from scratch.Joblib: Use libraries like Joblib or Pickle to serialize Python objects, including trained models, to disk.**
